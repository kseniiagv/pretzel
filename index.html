    <h1>Pretzel</h1>
    <p>
      A pretzel is a type of baked bread made from dough that is commonly shaped
      into a knot. The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive symmetrical
      form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined and then twisted
      back onto itself in a particular way (a pretzel loop or pretzel bow).
      Today, pretzels come in a wide range of shapes.

      <em>
        Salt is the most common seasoning for pretzels, complementing the
        washing soda or lye treatment that gives pretzels their traditional skin
        and flavor acquired through the Maillard reaction. Other seasonings are
        mustard, cheeses, sugar, chocolate, cinnamon, sweet glazing, seeds, and
        nuts. Varieties of pretzels include soft pretzels, which should be eaten
        shortly after preparation, and hard-baked pretzels, which have a long
        shelf life.
